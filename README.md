# Feature 'stack' package: 'pkg_stack' #

I have written documented package 'pkg_stack' which provide feature 'stack' functionality, with exception handling. I also threw in unittest, which is runnable after installing package, and it checks sanity of package 'pkg_stack'.      

###  Package Description: https://pypi.org/project/pkg-stack-skscodes/  ###

## Install package 'pkg_stack' via pip: ##         
```
$pip install pkg-stack-skscodes
