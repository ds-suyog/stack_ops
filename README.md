# Feature 'stack' package: 'pkg_stack' #

I have written documented package 'pkg_stack' which provide feature 'stack' functionality, with exception handling. I also threw in unittest, which is runnable after installing package, and cit checks sanity of package 'pkg_stack'.      

###  Package Description: https://pypi.org/project/pkg-stack-skscodes/  ###

## Install package 'pkg_stack' via pip: ##         
```
$pip install pkg-stack-skscodes
```     
     
## TO IMPORT PACKAGE:          ##
```
from pkg_stack.mystack import Stack
```

## Run source-code/scripts directly:     ##
To Run Demo:            
Run it, sit back and watch. It automatically executes stack-operations and tests, while displaying it on console in a video-like manner as it proceeds:         
```
$python mystack.py
```           
      
### Run unittest:         ##
