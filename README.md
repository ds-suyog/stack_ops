# stack_ops package
I have written documented package 'pkg_stack' which provide feature 'stack' functionality, with exception handling. I also threw in unittest, which is runnable after installing package, and cit checks sanity of package 'pkg_stack'.      
     
##INSTALL PACKAGE 'pkg_stack' via pip:         
`$pip install pkg-stack-skscodes`     
     
##TO IMPORT PACKAGE:          
`from pkg_stack.mystack import Stack`       

For rest information please refer README.md in directory package_storage      
     
     
##RUN SOURCE CODE:     
To Run Demo:            
Run it, sit back and watch. It automatically executes stack-operations and tests, while displaying it on console in a video-like manner as it proceeds:         
`$python mystack.py`           
      
###Run unittest:           
`$python stack_unittest.py`
